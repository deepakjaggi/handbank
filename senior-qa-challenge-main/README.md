# How to

## Run the application

- Execute `npm start` command
- Open [http://localhost:3000/weather](http://localhost:3000/weather) to view it in the browser

## Run the tests

- Execute `npm test` command

## Run the tests in parallel

-------------

#Results
1. I could not solve the test case where we want to verify that application can use the location, i tried to do some stubing but thats fake
2. I did not understand where you want me to create mock server end point ? In the project it self or in Postman or other tool ?
